# Vr-Enviroment  

A **Unity-based virtual reality (VR) prototype** showcasing basic world-building and interactivity.  

---

##  Project Overview  
**Vr-enviroment** is an introductory VR project created in Unity. The environment is built entirely from Unity primitives (no external assets), demonstrating:  
- Object creation  
- Scene composition  
- Basic interactivity  

The virtual space includes:  
-  Trees  
-  Benches  
-  Lamps  
-  Stones  
-  Flowers  

Although intentionally simple, this project provides a foundation for experimenting with VR mechanics and scene design.

## ✨ Features

- **Camera Interaction** → Clicking elsewhere moves the camera closer  
- **Custom Environment** → All objects handcrafted from Unity’s built-in shapes
