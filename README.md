Vr-enviroment

A Unity-based virtual reality (VR) environment prototype showcasing basic world-building and interactivity.

Project Overview

Vr-enviroment is an introductory VR project created in Unity. The environment was built entirely from Unity primitives, without external assets, to demonstrate core VR development concepts such as object creation, scene composition, and simple interactivity.

The virtual space includes:
Trees
Benches
Lamps
Stones
Flowers

Although the project is intentionally simple, it provides a foundation for experimenting with VR mechanics and scene design.

Features

Interactive Elements
Flowers disappear when clicked.

Camera Interaction
Clicking outside interactive objects moves the camera closer.

Custom Environment

All environment objects are manually constructed from Unityâ€™s built-in shapes.
